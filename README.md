# oyfa-website
A website for OYFA created by OYFA webmasters.
2019 - 2020 : Mara Hart and Brandon Ongtingco

This website is designed to be not only a hub for all club members, but an inspiration for other Filipino organizations looking to increase engagement and learn more about the culture.
This is a rough draft for the website where we will deploy all changes before publishing it openly.

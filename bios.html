          <p>Ysabel is a 3rd year English major! She is from the town of Vienna, Virginia and joined OYFA her first year to explore her Filipino culture. She ran for President because she has a vision for what the organization can be in regards to the increased awareness of Filipino culture for both OYFA's members and the UVA/Charlottesville community. She also wants to offer a space for people Filipino and Non-Filipino alike to create lasting bonds and to feel as if they can be themselves at our university.</p>
          <p>She's happiest when she is talking and connecting with others. Her favorite quote is from the new Cinderella movie with Lily James, "Have courage and be kind."</p>

But it's mostly because she's obsessed with Google Forms, spreadsheets, and slides.</p>
          <p>Dre's favorite quote is "Go ahead, make my day", as made famous by Clint Eastwood. She is happiest when she's doing completely spontaenous activities or travel with no planning involved.</p>

            Emil Lorenzo Cunanan Diaz is a 2nd year Biology major with a CS minor!  He lives in the city of Virginia Beach, VA with his mom and dog.  He joined OYFA his first year and ran for D7 because he wanted to connect not only his fellow Filipinos at UVA but as many from any other schools as possible!  Culture thrives through connectivity!
          </p>
          <p>
            Emil is most happy when he is rubbing his dog's belly and laughing with friends during the late hours of the night.  When he was 10, he really wanted to become a pilot, but alas, his eyes yeeted on him making him almost legally blind, crushing his childhood dream.  That's okay though, because he has realized that becoming a doctor has been his true passion all along.  He's also a sucker for good quotes, but his all time favorite quote is from Albert Camus, “In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.”

            <p>
              Jazlyn is a second year studing Cognitive Science with a concentration in Computer Science and Philosophy. She's from Stafford, VA and joined OYFA her first year. She  wanted to be Membership to give back to OYFA and give its members a time that was as great as hers was. She was also inspired by her relationship with her big. But there’s way more to Membership than the Big/Little system, and honestly learning about those deeper things got her to love (and hate) the position so much. The best thing about Membership to her is the people that you connect with, and the bridges you build between others.
            </p>
            <p>
              In her free time, Jazlyn likes to read tarot cards, and her favorite quote is "Champagne for my real friends real pain for my sham friends" — Happy Endings

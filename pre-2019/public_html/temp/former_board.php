						<b>1. Why did you decide for run for this board position?</b><br>
I've been involved with OYFA council since my first year, and being President is my biggest way of giving back to an organization that I've called home these past three years. 
						<p>
						<b>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</b><br>
In three words: family, food, & fun. All the memories we have made are the ones that I'll treasure the rest of my life. We've all been through the good and the bad and through the thick and thin - the late night study sessions in first year dorms, Culturefest and Barrio practices, impulsive late night food runs, hanging out in the Lawn, and so on. As we all branched out to different organizations after our first year, I can truly say that I can always go back to the people in OYFA no matter what. 

						</p>
						
						<p>
						<b>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</b><br>
I hated the high school program I did through UVA, and never saw myself coming here, but decided to ultimately attend because of its relatively close proximity to home (2 hours is not too close nor far from home) and the low instate tuition . I wasn't sure of going at first since I already wanted to pursue engineering, and while UVA was not known for engineering, I was afraid I might change majors. Still stuck with engineering BUT I'm glad I came here, UVA grounds is beautiful, Charlottesville food is great, extracurricular groups are very involved, LOVE the UVA culture and all the traditions that surround us, and classes are great. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<b>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</b><br>
Definitely Courtney Cox, specifically her role as Monica Geller in Friends. In Friends, she's competitive, ambitious, a neat freak, the "Mother Hen" of the group, and wants everything under her control, kind of like my personality (but not as extreme as her).

						<b>1. Why did you decide for run for this board position?</b><br>
I chose to run as Vice President for OYFA because I want to get an opportunity to fine tune the organization's internal workings. I want to lead a cohesive and dedicated group of leaders that will push OYFA past its boundaries while preserving the goals for which it was established. Through this position, I wish to leave OYFA with strong, ambitious and skilled leaders with the creative drive to continue the growth of the organization for future years to come.
						<p>
						<b>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</b><br>
Just like what any other OYFAns will tell you, OYFA is a family, a home away from home. OYFA is an organization that brought me back to my culture after being 'Americanized' ever since I moved to the U.S. Through OYFA, I have met a great group of life long friends and a network of support who you can always rely on. This organization has given me a chance to explore what UVA has to offer from philanthropic events, to IM Sports, to artistic performances ... OYFA does it all!  
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<b>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</b><br>
I attended UVa for its prestige, beautiful grounds, and generous financial aid. The traditions, community of trust and student self-governance are only some of the many elements that sets Thomas Jefferson's University from other colleges in the nation. I knew from the beginning that UVA will be that place that will provide me with a good balance between academic rigor and social life.  
						</p>

						<b>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</b><br>
Sean Connery. I googled 'coolest actor' and he came in at number one.

						<b>1. Why did you decide for run for this board position?</b><br>
After being on council as a Community co-chair, I knew I wanted to continue to serve OYFA in some way. The treasurer position appealed to me since it is both an internal and external position. It requires me to work with all the council members as I make sure all of their events are funded, while I also reach out to the greater university community as I request for new partnerships and allocate funds from various sources. I'm also really excited to be a family head and can't wait to host plenty of fun events and chill sessions with everyone!						
						<p>
						<b>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</b><br>
OYFA is filled with people to mentor and guide you, to take you on adventures, and to help you to push the boundaries you once thought you could never go beyond. In just two years OYFA has helped me learn about myself and grow not only socially, but also academically through the advice and guidance of upperclassmen.						
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<b>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</b><br>
I actually had trouble deciding between UVA and William and Mary. However, after spending a few nights at UVA, during which I took in the unique atmosphere, the school spirit, the beautiful Grounds, and the academic opportunities, I immediately fell in love with the place and knew there was no where else I belonged.

						<b>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</b><br>
Even though he's like a million feet taller than me, I would want John Krasinski (Jim from The Office) to play me. He's a really chill guy who always seems to be put in the middle of crazy, insane situations with irrational people. As a result, he has to be the voice of reason and brings everyone back to reality to figure out what needs to be done. I feel like I end up being that person a lot of the time, not to mention he's a pretty awesome dude.

						<b>1. Why did you decide for run for this board position?</b><br>
	If I told you that the Organization of Young Filipino Americans didn't play a role in my college experience, I'd be lying. OYFA has given me everything I've wanted at UVA: strong bonds with close friends that I will never forget. With that said, I decided to run for Corresponding Secretary to not only give back to the Organization for what it has given me, but also to continue its traditions of being the most welcoming, most fun, and overall BEST CIO On-Grounds. Besides my Constitutional duties as Corresponding Secretary, I ran for this position so that I can get to know everyone in the organization to help create a genuine sense of "OYFAmily."
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<b>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</b><br>
	I know everyone says this, but OYFA really is family and a home away from home. Most, if not all, my close friends are OYFAns. Whenever you're around OYFAns, it's so easy to be yourself.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<b>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</b><br>
I didn't know where else to go and I heard UVA was a pretty good school so I decided to go here without even visiting. I haven't regretted my decision one bit!

						<b>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</b><br>
	Probably Patrick Star..ya know.. from Spongebob. He's funny lol.

						<b>1. Why did you decide for run for this board position?</b><br>
	I ran for Recording Secretary because I wanted to be a part of the leadership that makes OYFA such an amazing organization. Rec-Sec was the best choice for me because I felt that I could best utilize my past experiences and skills in this position, and combine them with my love for OYFA to be the best leader that I could be.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<b>2. What does OYFA mean to you?</b><br>
	To me, OYFA is a place that I can always come back to at the end of the day to share stories, laugh, and learn. This organization is full of caring, passionate people who look out for one another and support each other, and I’m glad to have joined it my first year at UVA.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<b>3. Why did you decide to go to UVA for college?</b><br>
 I guess I couldn’t ignore the fact that UVA is one of the top public universities in the nation, and only 2.5 hours away from home. But aside from that fact there were a few other reasons. The scenery is so beautiful, and structures so grand that it makes me feel like I am a part of something much bigger. UVA is also home to the McIntire School of Commerce, a place I hope to attend if I can survive my pre-requisites.
						</p>
						
						<p>
						<b>4. If there was a movie made about your life, who would you want to play you and why?</b><br>
I would love to be played by Zooey Deschanel because the movie would be great just by her being in it! I also think we share some similar qualities. She can be bubbly and kind of goofy, and she’s always singing and humming spontaneously on “New Girl”, which reminds me a lot of myself.
